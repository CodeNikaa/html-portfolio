<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hay Guys,
  My name is Tobias, i'm currently by the time of writing this portfolio "About Me" page from Angela Yu's Web Developer course over on Udemy
  in Germany and working as a Gateman/Porter and just moved to a different City.
</p>

<p>I started out getting trained as a painter and varnisher (hope its spelled correctly just took that from the google translator xD) after that 
  i worked at the company i got educated for about 9-10 Years before quitting my Job and tried to move to a different are like coding.
  My Coding Journey started wierd, because i tried many language and often could'nt quite stick to a single language because 
  i did'nt want to specialize at that time. But until now, some time has passed and i looked in many different languages and 
  Job Fields until i moved to a different city and said to myself that i'm gonna stick with Webdevelopment for now and maybe land a job in the future.
</p>

<p>This Portfolio Website will i hope be just the beginning and maybe thanks to Angela Yu i become the Developer/Programmer i always wanted to be and 
  finally set foot in the tech industry.
